# Beads

It started out when my daughter and I was playing with Hama beads (http://www.hama.dk). I wanted to create some better and more funny pegboards. So I created this little program to convert a 24bit image to a pegboard. I have seen a few on the internet but all of them assume that you have all the beads in every color. So I have created a version where you can specify a list of the beads that you and your kid have.

I have add 2 color list of beads that I have found online. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get a list of RGB values from Hama.

# Requirements
